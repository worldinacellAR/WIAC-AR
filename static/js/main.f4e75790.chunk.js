It wasn\u2019t working because the asset needed a collider in order for us to be able to interact with it. So we were able to implement touching an asset to toggle other asset\u2019s visibility.

Bryan provided us with simple shapes with a collider from Unity for us to test and we were able to generate spatial sound from Unity. Both assets were successfully imported into Enklu however, the collider wasn\u2019t working. While one teammate remained on Unity prefab task, the rest of us explored on gaze function, gestures, generating assets from JavaScript (for tossing multiple proteins into play space), and multiplayer setup.

Later, we will add scaling so that the player can move the object on a 2D plane similar to Enklu\u2019s editor (which is what the original design team hoped for). We will also explore the function to toss the proteins onto the play space using a flicking motion. For debugging purposes, we were able to add a text log onto the screen.
